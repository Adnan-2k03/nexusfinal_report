Traditional methods of player discovery rely on manual community searches, informal networking, or third-party platforms with limited real-time functionality. This project addresses this gap by introducing <strong>Nexus</strong>, a real-time player finding system designed specifically for competitive gaming communities.</p><p>Nexus is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) platform that leverages modern web technologies and real-time communication protocols to enable seamless player discovery and connection. The system employs a sophisticated matching algorithm that considers multiple factors including game expertise, skill level, regional preferences, and play style compatibility to recommend suitable players.</p><p>The architecture employs a split deployment model: a React-based frontend hosted on Vercel providing a responsive neon cyberpunk-themed user interface, an Express.js backend running on Railway, and PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage. WebSocket technology enables real-time match updates and notifications, providing users with instant alerts when new matches become available or when other players express interest in their profiles.</p><p>Key features include real-time match discovery, smart player matching, match request management, browser push notifications, voice communication integration via 100ms, and Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality for native app-like experience on desktop and mobile platforms.</p><p>The implementation incorporates security best practices including phone number verification via Firebase Authentication, secure session management, CORS configuration, and comprehensive error handling. The production deployment is cost-efficient, leveraging free tier services from industry-leading providers including Vercel, Railway, Firebase, 100ms, and Cloudflare, resulting in zero upfront deployment costs while maintaining production-grade reliability.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Real-time Systems, Player Matching Algorithm, Competitive Gaming, Web Technologies, WebSocket Communication, Progressive Web Apps, Cloud Deployment</p><p>---</p><p>#<h1>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h1></p><p>| S.No. | Chapter | Title | Page No. |<br>|-------|---------|-------|----------|<br>| 1 | - | Acknowledgements | 5 |<br>| 2 | - | Abstract | 6 |<br>| 3 | - | List of Figures and Tables | 8 |<br>| 4 | 1 | Introduction | 9 |<br>| - | 1.1 | Problem Statement & Objectives | 10 |<br>| - | 1.2 | Background and Literature Survey | 11 |<br>| - | 1.3 | Motivation and Scope | 12 |<br>| 5 | 2 | System Architecture and Design | 13 |<br>| - | 2.1 | Proposed System Overview | 13 |<br>| - | 2.2 | Working Methodology | 14 |<br>| - | 2.3 | System Architecture Diagram | 15 |<br>| - | 2.4 | Technical Stack and Technologies | 16 |<br>| - | 2.4.1 | Frontend Technologies | 16 |<br>| - | 2.4.2 | Backend Technologies | 18 |<br>| - | 2.4.3 | Database Design | 20 |<br>| 6 | 3 | Implementation Details | 22 |<br>| - | 3.1 | Module Description | 22 |<br>| - | 3.2 | Real-Time Communication Protocol | 24 |<br>| - | 3.3 | Matching Algorithm | 25 |<br>| 7 | 4 | Deployment and Infrastructure | 27 |<br>| - | 4.1 | Production Architecture | 27 |<br>| - | 4.2 | External Services Integration | 28 |<br>| - | 4.3 | Security Measures | 30 |<br>| 8 | 5 | Results and Performance | 31 |<br>| - | 5.1 | User Interface and Features | 31 |<br>| - | 5.2 | System Performance Metrics | 33 |<br>| 9 | 6 | Cost Analysis | 34 |<br>| - | 6.1 | Deployment Costs | 34 |<br>| - | 6.2 | Development Tools and Services | 35 |<br>| 10 | 7 | Conclusion and Future Works | 36 |<br>| 11 | 8 | References | 37 |<br>| 12 | 9 | Appendix | 38 |</p><p>---</p><p>#<h1>LIST OF FIGURES AND TABLES</h1></p><p>##<h1>List of Figures</h1></p><p>| Figure No. | Title | Page No. |<br>|------------|-------|----------|<br>| 1 | Competitive Gaming Market Growth | 9 |<br>| 2 | System Architecture Diagram | 13 |<br>| 3 | Data Flow Diagram | 14 |<br>| 4 | Database Schema Diagram | 20 |<br>| 5 | User Registration and Authentication Flow | 22 |<br>| 6 | Match Discovery Interface | 31 |<br>| 7 | Player Profile Page | 31 |<br>| 8 | Real-Time Match Feed with WebSocket Updates | 32 |<br>| 9 | Push Notification System | 32 |<br>| 10 | Voice Communication Interface | 33 |</p><p>##<h1>List of Tables</h1></p><p>| Table No. | Title | Page No. |<br>|-----------|-------|----------|<br>| 1 | Technology Stack Components | 16 |<br>| 2 | Database Tables and Schema | 20 |<br>| 3 | API Endpoints Summary | 24 |<br>| 4 | External Services and Integration | 28 |<br>| 5 | Deployment Cost Analysis | 34 |<br>| 6 | System Performance Metrics | 33 |</p><p>---</p><p>#<h1>CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION</h1></p><p>##<h1>1.1 Problem Statement and Objectives</h1></p><p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></p><p>The competitive gaming industry has experienced exponential growth over the past decade, with millions of players worldwide competing in games like Valorant, Counter-Strike 2, Rocket League, and others. Despite this growth, one fundamental challenge persists: finding suitable teammates and opponents efficiently and reliably.</p><p>Current solutions suffer from significant limitations:</p><p>1. <strong>Fragmented Solutions:</strong> Players rely on Discord servers, Reddit communities, and informal networking, which are time-consuming and unreliable.<br>2. <strong>Lack of Real-Time Updates:</strong> Traditional platforms cannot provide instant notifications when new matches become available.<br>3. <strong>Poor Matching Quality:</strong> Existing solutions often lack sophisticated algorithms to match players based on compatibility factors beyond basic skill levels.<br>4. <strong>Limited Features:</strong> Most platforms lack integrated communication tools, voice channels, and comprehensive profile management.<br>5. <strong>Geographic Barriers:</strong> Players struggle to find opponents/teammates within their preferred regions and timezones.</p><p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p><p>The primary objectives of the Nexus project are:</p><p>1. <strong>Develop a real-time player discovery platform</strong> that enables instantaneous matching and connection between players.<br>2. <strong>Implement an intelligent matching algorithm</strong> that considers multiple factors including skill level, game expertise, region, and play style.<br>3. <strong>Create a responsive, user-friendly interface</strong> with a modern cyberpunk aesthetic that enhances user engagement.<br>4. <strong>Integrate real-time communication features</strong> including WebSocket-based notifications and voice channels.<br>5. <strong>Deploy a production-ready system</strong> using cost-efficient cloud infrastructure with zero upfront deployment costs.<br>6. <strong>Ensure security and data privacy</strong> through robust authentication, encryption, and secure session management.<br>7. <strong>Provide Progressive Web App functionality</strong> enabling users to install the platform as a native application.</p><p>##<h1>1.2 Background and Literature Survey</h1></p><p><strong>Related Work:</strong></p><p>Several platforms address player finding in gaming:</p><p>1. <strong>Discord and Community Servers:</strong> Widely used but lack dedicated matching algorithms and real-time features.<br>2. <strong>LFG.com:</strong> Provides looking-for-group listings but lacks real-time updates and sophisticated matching.<br>3. <strong>Valorant Finding Services:</strong> Game-specific but limited in scope and integration capabilities.<br>4. <strong>Traditional Matchmaking Systems:</strong> Integrated within games but don't allow pre-match player discovery and connection.</p><p><strong>Key Insights from Literature:</strong></p><p>- Real-time systems require WebSocket or similar persistent connection protocols for optimal user experience<br>- Matching algorithms perform better when considering multiple factors beyond simple skill metrics<br>- PWA technology has gained significant adoption for platform accessibility<br>- Cloud-based deployment offers scalability and reliability advantages for MVP products</p><p><strong>Technology Foundations:</strong></p><p>The project builds upon established technologies:</p><p>- <strong>React 18+:</strong> Modern frontend framework with hooks and component-based architecture<br>- <strong>Express.js:</strong> Lightweight, flexible Node.js framework for building scalable APIs<br>- <strong>WebSocket Protocol:</strong> Enables full-duplex communication for real-time updates<br>- <strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> Robust relational database with advanced querying capabilities<br>- <strong>Drizzle ORM:</strong> Type-safe database query builder with Zod validation integration</p><p>##<h1>1.3 Motivation and Scope</h1></p><p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p><p>The esports and competitive gaming sector represents a multi-billion-dollar industry with millions of dedicated players. Addressing the player-finding challenge directly impacts user satisfaction, retention, and platform growth.
