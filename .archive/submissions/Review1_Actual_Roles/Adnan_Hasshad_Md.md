## Project and Task Description

### Project Summary
The project, "A Real-Time Player Finding System," is an MVP social platform designed to help users find and connect with others for specific gaming activities. The application will address the challenge of finding compatible teammates or opponents for online games. The MVP will focus on core functionality with an intuitive UI, including user profiles, a public request board, a 1v1 and team finder, and a real-time status system. The approach will utilize modern full-stack technologies to build a responsive, serverless application that prioritizes immediate, action-oriented requests with WebSocket-based real-time updates.

### Individual Role and Tasks
As the project manager and originator of the project idea, my responsibilities will encompass project leadership, overall coordination, and technical contributions across the full stack. Specifically, I will:

1. **Project Management & Leadership**
   - Define project requirements and specifications
   - Create project timeline and milestones
   - Coordinate team efforts and ensure progress tracking
   - Facilitate communication between team members
   - Manage project scope and deliverables

2. **System Architecture & Design**
   - Design the overall system architecture and technology stack
   - Plan database schema and data models
   - Define API specifications and contracts
   - Establish coding standards and best practices for the team

3. **Backend Development**
   - Design and implement the Express.js backend server
   - Develop REST API endpoints for core functionality
   - Implement WebSocket integration for real-time features
   - Build business logic for player discovery, search filtering, and user management

4. **Integration & Configuration**
   - Plan and integrate third-party services (OAuth, Firebase, etc.)
   - Configure deployment environment and build system
   - Manage environment variables and secrets
   - Oversee system testing and quality assurance

5. **Documentation & Knowledge Transfer**
   - Create project documentation and technical specifications
   - Document API endpoints and system architecture
   - Provide technical guidance to team members
   - Maintain project repository and version control standards

### Approach
The project management and technical approach will span 4 phases:
- **Phase 1 (Week 1-2):** Project planning, requirements definition, architecture design, team coordination setup
- **Phase 2 (Week 3-4):** Backend infrastructure development, API implementation, team support for frontend and backend work
- **Phase 3 (Week 5-6):** Integration of services, system coordination, cross-component testing, performance optimization
- **Phase 4 (Week 7-8):** Project finalization, documentation completion, deployment, team coordination for final deliverables

## Outcome Matrix

| Outcome | Plan for Demonstrating Outcome |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| a) An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering | Will apply software engineering principles to system design, utilize data structures for player discovery and search functionality, and implement relational database concepts. |
| c) An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints | Will design comprehensive system architecture balancing functionality, performance, scalability, and development timeline constraints. |
| d) An ability to function on multidisciplinary teams | Will lead team coordination, facilitate collaboration between frontend and backend developers, and manage team dynamics throughout project. |
| e) An ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems | Will identify system bottlenecks, formulate solutions for integration challenges, and troubleshoot issues across multiple system components. |
| g) An ability to communicate effectively | Will create comprehensive documentation, clearly communicate requirements and decisions to team, and provide technical guidance and feedback. |
| k) An ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice | Will utilize full-stack technologies including React, Express.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, WebSocket API, OAuth, and DevOps tools. |
