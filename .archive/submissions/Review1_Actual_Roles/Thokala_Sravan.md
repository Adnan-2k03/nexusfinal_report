## Project and Task Description

### Project Summary
The project, "A Real-Time Player Finding System," is an MVP social platform designed to help users find and connect with others for specific gaming activities. The application will address the challenge of finding compatible teammates or opponents for online games. The MVP will focus on core functionality with an intuitive UI, including user profiles, a public request board, a 1v1 and team finder, and a real-time status system. The approach will utilize modern full-stack technologies to build a responsive, serverless application that prioritizes immediate, action-oriented requests with WebSocket-based real-time updates.

### Individual Role and Tasks
As the frontend developer, my primary responsibilities will focus on designing and implementing the user-facing application. Specifically, I will:

1. **Frontend Architecture & Setup**
   - Configure React with Vite for optimized development and production builds
   - Establish component structure following modern React patterns
   - Set up Tailwind CSS for styling with custom theme configuration
   - Implement client-side routing using Wouter

2. **UI Component Development**
   - Design and build reusable UI components using shadcn/ui library
   - Create form components for user input and interactions
   - Develop layouts for displaying player profiles and search results
   - Implement interactive modals and dialogs

3. **User Interface Implementation**
   - Create responsive landing page with feature showcase
   - Design user dashboard with player request management
   - Build player discovery and search interface with filtering by skill and game preferences
   - Implement notification center for real-time updates

4. **State Management & Data Fetching**
   - Integrate TanStack React Query for data fetching and caching
   - Implement custom hooks for form and data management
   - Set up proper error handling and loading states
   - Manage user authentication state and persistence

5. **Real-time Integration & Testing**
   - Connect WebSocket functionality for live updates
   - Implement real-time notification display
   - Integrate frontend with backend APIs
   - Conduct responsive design testing and optimization

### Approach
The frontend development will follow a component-driven approach across 4 phases:
- **Phase 1 (Week 1-2):** UI/UX design specification, component library setup, design system creation
- **Phase 2 (Week 3-4):** Core page development, form implementation, basic routing
- **Phase 3 (Week 5-6):** Real-time features integration, notification system, state management
- **Phase 4 (Week 7-8):** Responsive design refinement, optimization, testing, performance tuning

## Outcome Matrix

| Outcome | Plan for Demonstrating Outcome |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| a) An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering | Will apply UI/UX design principles, responsive design algorithms, and efficient rendering strategies. |
| c) An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints | Will design frontend architecture considering browser performance, network latency, and device compatibility constraints. |
| d) An ability to function on multidisciplinary teams | Will collaborate with backend developer on API integration and coordinate design decisions with project lead. |
| e) An ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems | Will address state management challenges, solve responsive design issues, and optimize component performance. |
| g) An ability to communicate effectively | Will create UI documentation, provide component guides, and communicate design decisions effectively. |
| k) An ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice | Will utilize React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack React Query, Wouter, shadcn/ui, and modern browser APIs. |
