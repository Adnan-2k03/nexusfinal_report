## Script & Timeline

### [0:00 - 0:45] Opening Hook - The Gamer Problem (45 seconds)

**What to say:**
> "Good [morning/afternoon]. Quick question - how many of you play multiplayer games? [pause for hands] 
>
> Imagine this: It's Friday night. You've got 2 hours to game. You fire up Valorant, but your usual squad isn't online. So you spend the next 30 minutes:
> - Posting 'LFG Gold Rank EU' on Reddit  
> - Checking Discord servers hoping someone responds
> - Joining random lobbies and getting toxic teammates
> - Finally finding a group... and they're all Bronze when you're Platinum
>
> By the time you find decent teammates, your gaming session is half over.
>
> Or worse - you're building an esports team. Every single day you're too tired to post recruitment details in Discord channels again. 'Looking for Diamond support player, must know these agents, available 8pm-12pm for rank pushing...' Copy, paste, post. Every. Single. Day.
>
> **This is the problem we solved.**"

**What to do:**
- Make eye contact, show frustration (relatable!)
- Use hand gestures for emphasis
- Transition smoothly to demo

- Select game: Valorant
- Select mode: Competitive
- Select rank range: Gold to Platinum
- Region: EU West
- Add note: "Looking for chill team, no toxic"
- Submit

**Say:**
> "In 10 seconds, I've posted exactly what I need. Now other gamers can instantly find me with filters."

**Scenario 2: Long-term Recruitment (The Game-Changer):**

- Requirements: "Platinum players, mic required, serious but chill"
- Submit

**Say:**
> "Now here's what's revolutionary - I post this ONCE. When other players see this and apply, **I get push notifications on my phone**. No more posting the same recruitment message in Discord every day when I'm tired. Create once, receive applications. The request stays active until my roster is full."

### [3:30 - 5:00] Problem & Major Use Cases (1.5 minutes)

**The Gamer Pain Points:**
> "Why did we build this? Because current solutions are broken for gamers:
>
> **Discord** is great for voice, terrible for finding new teammates. You're stuck posting 'LFG' in text channels hoping someone sees it. And if you're recruiting for esports? You have to post the same detailed requirements every single day because Discord messages get buried. Too tired to write it all out again? Tough luck.
>
> **LFG websites** like Reddit r/ApexLFG or GamerLink have no voice integration. You match with someone, then have to exchange Discord tags, add each other, create a server... 5 minutes wasted. And there's no persistent profile - you can't just post your detailed gaming background once and let people find you.
>
> **In-game matchmaking** gives you random teammates. No filters, no communication beforehand, often toxic. And forget about finding long-term teammates for a month-long rank push - impossible.
>
> **Premium platforms** like Guilded or TeamSpeak hosting cost $10-30/month. Students and casual gamers can't afford that."

**The Major Use Cases We Solve:**

> "Let me show you the THREE critical scenarios Nexus Match handles perfectly:
>
> **Use Case 1: Long-Term Esports Recruitment**
> - You're building a competitive team and need teammates with specific skills
> - On Discord: You post detailed requirements every day - 'Need Diamond support, knows smokes, 8-12pm available, mic required, VOD review willingness...'
> - Problem: Not everyone posts these details in Discord because they don't know what to include OR they're too tired to type it all out repeatedly
> - **Nexus Match Solution:** Create ONE detailed profile with all your requirements. Qualified gamers apply. You get notifications. Review their complete profiles when YOU have time. No more daily posting fatigue.
>
> **Use Case 2: Time-Specific Rank Pushing**
> - Want to find teammates for 8pm to 12pm sessions for rank pushing the whole month?
> - On Discord: You'd have to post 'LFG 8-12pm' every single night and hope to find the same people
> - **Nexus Match Solution:** Input those details ONCE - '8pm-12pm daily for whole month, goal: Diamond rank.' When gamers match your schedule and skill apply, you get notifications. Build your consistent squad without daily recruitment grind.
>
> **Use Case 3: Application Notifications (Anti-Fatigue)**
> - You post recruitment details and go about your day
> - When someone applies who matches your requirements, you receive push notification
> - No more refreshing Discord channels, no more reposting when tired
> - Review applicants' full profiles at your convenience - all their details already visible
>
> These aren't hypothetical - these are the exact problems we as gamers face when trying to build serious teams or find committed teammates."

**Our Solution:**
> "Nexus Match combines everything gamers actually need:
>
> ✓ **Smart Matchmaking** - Find teammates by skill, game, and playstyle in seconds  
> ✓ **Persistent Requests** - Post detailed requirements ONCE, receive applications via notifications  
> ✓ **Time-Specific Sessions** - "8pm-12pm rank pushing for whole month" - create once, gamers apply  
> ✓ **Rich Gamer Profiles** - Showcase your rank, clips, achievements - stop reposting your details  
> ✓ **Integrated Voice** - No separate apps, just click and talk  
> ✓ **Real-time Notifications** - Get push alerts when someone applies to your request  
> ✓ **Mobile PWA** - Game anywhere, get notified anywhere  
> ✓ **Almost Free** - ~$5/month infrastructure vs. $100+ for competitors
>
> It's like if Discord and a premium LFG platform had a baby, but with the intelligence to remember your details and notify you of perfect matches."

## Talking Points Cheat Sheet

### If Asked: "How is this different from Discord?"
> "Discord is voice-first with basic text chat. We're matchmaking-first with integrated voice. Discord has no skill filtering, no rank matching, no playstyle tags. You're just posting 'LFG' and hoping. We give gamers tools to find quality teammates in seconds, not minutes."

### If Asked: "Does voice quality match Discord?"
> "We use 100ms, which powers professional streaming platforms. Voice quality is comparable or better, with sub-200ms latency. The difference is we've integrated it into the matchmaking flow - no separate server setup needed."

### If Asked: "What games are supported?"
> "Any game! It's user-driven. Currently our community plays Valorant, Apex Legends, League of Legends, Fortnite, Overwatch, Rainbow Six - but gamers can add any title to their profile. The platform is game-agnostic."

### If Demo Glitches:
> "Even pro gamers deal with lag sometimes! Let me show you the backup recording while the connection reestablishes..."
*Stay calm, smile, switch to video smoothly*
