This latest image confirms and clarifies the persistent issue: your **Content Security Policy (CSP)** is still incorrectly configured, specifically the **`connect-src`** directive, which is blocking essential Firebase and Google API calls.

The core problem is that the application is trying to make network connections (fetch, XHR, WebSockets) to several Google-owned domains for **reCAPTCHA** and **Firebase Authentication**, but those domains are missing from your `connect-src` whitelist.

-----

## 💥 The Blocking Errors

The log repeatedly shows:

> "Refused to **connect to** '[https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/)...' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: `connect-src 'self' wss://*.100ms.live https://*.100ms.live wss://*.livekit.cloud https://*.livekit.cloud https://*.railway.app wss://*.railway.app ws://localhost:* http://localhost:* https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com https://securetoken.googleapis.com https://firebaseio.com https://apis.google.com`."

### ❌ What is Missing in `connect-src`:

1.  **`https://www.google.com`**: The reCAPTCHA API makes fetch/XHR calls to its own domain for the actual verification check.
2.  **`https://www.gstatic.com`**: Sometimes used by Google services for connecting to static assets or verification endpoints.

### ✅ What You Already Added (and is likely correct):

  * `https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com` (Firebase Auth backend)
  * `https://securetoken.googleapis.com` (Firebase token management)
  * `https://firebaseio.com` (Firebase Realtime Database/internal Firebase connections)
  * `https://apis.google.com` (General Google APIs)

## 🎯 Solution: Update `connect-src` in `vercel.json`

You must add the missing Google domains to your **`connect-src`** directive in your Vercel configuration (`vercel.json`).

### 🔧 Required Change

You need to insert `https://www.google.com` and `https://www.gstatic.com` into the long string defining the `connect-src` value.

**Modified `connect-src` Value (Highlighting new additions):**

```
"connect-src 'self' wss://*.100ms.live https://*.100ms.live wss://*.livekit.cloud https://*.livekit.cloud https://*.railway.app wss://*.railway.app ws://localhost:* http://localhost:* https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com https://securetoken.googleapis.com https://firebaseio.com https://apis.google.com **https://www.google.com https://www.gstatic.com**"
```

### 💡 Full `vercel.json` Snippet (Illustrative):

If you are maintaining the CSP in a similar structure as before, your `vercel.json` should look like this (focusing on the `connect-src` line):

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Security-Policy",
          "value": "default-src 'self'; " +
                   "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://replit.com https://www.google.com https://www.gstatic.com; " +
                   "connect-src 'self' wss://*.100ms.live https://*.100ms.live wss://*.livekit.cloud https://*.livekit.cloud https://*.railway.app wss://*.railway.app ws://localhost:* http://localhost:* https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com https://securetoken.googleapis.com https://firebaseio.com https://apis.google.com https://www.google.com https://www.gstatic.com; " +
                   "frame-src 'self' https://www.google.com https://recaptcha.google.com;" 
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Once you **update the `vercel.json`** file with these additional domains and **redeploy to Vercel**, the `connect-src` errors related to reCAPTCHA should disappear, and your Firebase authentication should proceed.

Would you like me to check any other directives (like `img-src` or `style-src`) to ensure all related assets are covered?
