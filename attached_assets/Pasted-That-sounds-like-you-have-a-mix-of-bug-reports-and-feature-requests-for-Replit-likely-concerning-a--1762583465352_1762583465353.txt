That sounds like you have a mix of bug reports and feature requests for Replit, likely concerning a mobile app or specific features within the platform.

Here is a proposed organization and formatting of your points, making them clearer for submission as feedback or bug reports, without changing the nature of your requests:

 

🐛 Bug Reports & Technical Issues
 


 

Voice/Mic Functionality Issues
 

Background Mic Issue: When the application is in the background (not actively open on screen), the microphone is not working.
Voice Channel/Messages Linking: In both the voice channel and messages, voices (audio streams) should not be linked.
Voice Channel Quality: The voice channel functionality should be totally perfect (implies a need for stability, clarity, and reliability fixes).
 

Screen Share & Invite Issues
 

Screen Share in Messages: Screen share is not working within the messages section.
Invite/Friends List Discrepancy: The "Invite Friends" feature in messages is not functioning correctly for users in existing connections.

It displays the message: "No friends to invite. Add friends first!"
It shows "Invite 0 friend(s)" even when there are people in the user's connections/friends list.

the status display in the matching feature must be accurate, avoid ambiguity, and align with a professional, user-friendly UI/UX standard.
 

✨ Feature Requests & UI/UX Enhancements
 
 

User Interface (UI) Adjustments
 

Phone Indicators Color: Feature Focus: Call Status Indicator Color (The visual indicator shown when a user is actively in a voice channel or on a call in messages).

Current Issue/Goal: The color of this indicator needs to be changed.
Title Bar Icon Uniformity: Make the voice/mic symbol in the title uniform with all other page title symbols to ensure a cohesive look across the application.
 

Content Loading
 

Photo Fetch: Ensure correct and consistent photo fetching (likely referring to profile pictures, images in messages, or images within a Repl project).
Would you like me to help you format any of these points further, perhaps as individual, detailed bug reports?
