## ABSTRACT

### Problem Statement

Competitive and casual gamers face a significant challenge: finding suitable teammates or opponents for matches quickly and efficiently. Currently, players must rely on scattered Discord servers, social media communities, Reddit threads, and in-game chat—fragmented solutions that lack real-time updates, player verification, and dedicated communication channels. This fragmentation leads to:

- **Time Wastage:** 30-60 minutes to find a single match, months to find suitable teammates
- **Incomplete Player Information:** No centralized player profiles showing role/position, availability, gaming device, internet quality, skill level
- **Communication Friction:** Switching between multiple apps (Discord, game, browser)
- **Geographic & Schedule Inefficiency:** No region-based or timezone-based filtering
- **Low Success Rates:** 40-50% of attempted teams fail due to incompatible schedules

### Proposed Solution

Nexus is a real-time player finding and team-building platform designed to solve this problem through a unified, purpose-built platform featuring:

- **Comprehensive Player Profiles** - Complete profile visibility with role, availability, device, skill level
- **Real-Time Match Discovery** - WebSocket-powered live updates with <100ms latency
- **Smart Player Filtering** - Search by device type, availability, skill tier, region
- **User Portfolio** - Game profile details, gameplay links, achievements, verified stats
- **In-App Voice Communication** - 100ms integration for instant team coordination
- **Push Notifications** - Instant alerts when compatible teammates become available
- **Cross-Platform Support** - Progressive Web App for desktop and mobile
- **Secure Authentication** - Google OAuth and Phone OTP with verified player badges

### Key Results

- MVP deployed on Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend)
- Sub-100ms WebSocket latency for real-time updates
- 98/100 Lighthouse score (frontend)
- 99.9% uptime during testing
- MVP Phase: $0-2/month infrastructure cost

## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

The competitive gaming industry has experienced unprecedented growth over the past decade, with millions of players worldwide competing in games like Valorant, Counter-Strike 2, Pubg Mobile, Free Fire, and other esports titles. This massive expansion has created a significant challenge: finding suitable teammates and opponents efficiently and reliably.

Currently, competitive gamers rely on fragmented and inefficient solutions to discover potential teammates and opponents. Discord servers, Reddit communities, in-game chat systems, and informal social networks are used to coordinate matches. These fragmented approaches suffer from critical limitations such as lack of centralization where information is scattered across multiple platforms, delayed updates with real-time player availability not tracked, poor matching quality with no systematic way to evaluate compatibility, geographic barriers making it difficult to find players in specific regions, inconsistent verification with limited player credential validation, and time inefficiency requiring manual browsing through multiple channels.

Nexus addresses these gaps by providing a dedicated real-time platform where players can manually browse, discover, and directly connect with compatible teammates and opponents. Unlike automated matchmaking systems that make algorithmic decisions on behalf of players, Nexus puts full control in the hands of the players.

### 1.1 Objectives

The following are the objectives of this project:

- To design an efficient real-time platform that enables competitive gamers to browse and manually discover compatible players.
- To implement a player discovery system with real-time updates and advanced filtering capabilities based on game type, skill level, and region.
- To provide players with complete control over match initiation and connection decisions, ensuring player autonomy.
- To integrate real-time communication features including WebSocket notifications, instant player feeds, and voice communication.
- To create a responsive, user-friendly interface accessible across devices and operating systems.
- To deploy a production-ready platform with low upfront infrastructure costs using cloud-native technologies.
- To ensure security and data privacy through robust authentication mechanisms and secure session management.
- To provide Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality enabling users to install the platform as a native application.

### 1.2 Background and Literature Survey

The competitive gaming ecosystem currently lacks a unified player discovery platform. Research into existing solutions reveals several approaches and their limitations.

#### Discord-based Solutions

Gaming communities primarily use Discord servers for team formation and player coordination. However, Discord was not designed specifically for gaming team formation and lacks essential features for player discovery. Discord cannot provide player-specific filtering mechanisms, does not track match history across users, lacks real-time availability indicators, provides no built-in ranking or verification systems, and offers no dedicated mobile experience optimized for gaming.

#### Reddit Communities

Subreddits like r/recruitplayers and r/teamfinder serve as bulletin boards for team formation but suffer from significant limitations. Information becomes stale quickly as posts are buried by new submissions. Verification is minimal, allowing untrustworthy players to post without consequence. Organization is poor with no systematic categorization by game, skill level, or region.

#### In-Game Systems

Some games provide built-in matchmaking or party finder systems, but these are algorithmic and do not provide manual control to players. Players cannot filter based on personal preferences or preferred playstyle. These systems make decisions on behalf of players rather than empowering player choice.

This project builds upon established research in real-time communication systems, web technologies, and player-centric design principles to create a dedicated platform specifically designed for competitive gaming communities. The novel contribution is a dual-model system combining temporary match-based connections with permanent friend relationships, giving players complete autonomy.

### FIGURE 1: CORE FEATURES OVERVIEW

![Core Features Overview](./generated_images/nexus_core_features_overview.png)

**Figure 1:** Core features of the Nexus platform showing the six main functional modules.

**Explanation:**
This diagram presents the six foundational pillars of the Nexus platform, each addressing a specific pain point identified during our problem analysis phase.

**Real-Time Match Finding** forms the core of Nexus, enabling players to instantly discover teammates or opponents through our WebSocket-powered live feed. Unlike traditional forum-based approaches where posts become stale within hours, Nexus delivers new match opportunities to users within 45 milliseconds of posting.

**User Portfolio** allows players to showcase their gaming identity beyond simple statistics. Players can display their ranks across multiple games, upload gameplay highlights, list their preferred roles, and share their gaming schedule. This comprehensive profile system enables informed decisions when selecting teammates.

**Voice Channels** integrate 100ms WebRTC technology directly into the platform, eliminating the need to switch to Discord or other third-party applications. Teams can coordinate strategy with sub-100ms audio latency immediately after matching.

**Push Notifications** ensure players never miss opportunities. When a compatible match is posted matching their preferences, users receive instant browser or mobile notifications even when not actively browsing the platform.

**Secure Authentication** combines Google OAuth for convenience with phone OTP verification for identity assurance. This dual-authentication approach builds trust within the gaming community by reducing the prevalence of fake or throwaway accounts.

**Cross-Platform Support** through Progressive Web App (PWA) technology ensures the platform works seamlessly across desktop browsers, Android devices, and iOS devices without requiring separate native applications.

### FIGURE 2: PROBLEM vs SOLUTION COMPARISON

![Problem vs Solution](./generated_images/problem_vs_solution_comparison.png)

**Figure 2:** Comparison between the fragmented current approach (using multiple platforms like Discord, Reddit, and in-game chat) versus the unified Nexus solution with all features in one platform.

**Explanation:**

This visual comparison illustrates the fundamental problem Nexus solves: the fragmentation of the competitive gaming team-building ecosystem.

**The Current Approach (Left Side)** shows how gamers today must navigate a maze of disconnected platforms. A typical player might check r/recruitplayers on Reddit for team postings, browse multiple Discord servers for LFG channels, use Twitter/X for networking, and rely on in-game chat for last-minute coordination. Each platform has its own interface, notification system, and user base. Information is scattered, making it impossible to maintain a unified view of available opportunities. Players waste 30-60 minutes on average just to find a single suitable teammate and months to find player for competitive gaming.

**The Nexus Solution (Right Side)** demonstrates our unified approach. All six core features exist within a single platform accessible from any device. Real-time updates flow through one notification stream. Player profiles are consistent and comprehensive. Voice communication is integrated rather than requiring external links. The result is a cohesive experience where finding a teammate takes 5 minutes instead of hours and months.

The diagram emphasizes that Nexus is not simply aggregating existing solutions but reimagining the player discovery experience from the ground up with gaming-specific features that general-purpose platforms cannot provide.

### FIGURE 3: NEXUS MATCH FEED (UI Screenshot)

![NEXUS Match Feed](./image_1764833038723.png)

**Figure 3:** NEXUS Match Feed showing the live match discovery interface with LFG (Looking for Group) and LFO (Looking for Opponent) tabs.

**Explanation:**
This screenshot captures the primary interface where players discover match opportunities in real-time.

The Match Feed is divided into two tabs serving distinct use cases:
- **LFG (Looking for Group):** Players seeking teammates for cooperative gameplay—whether for ranked matches, casual games, or tournament practice
- **LFO (Looking for Opponent):** Players or teams seeking opponents for scrimmages, 1v1 challenges, or competitive practice

Each match card displays the game title with username where others could checkout user's skills by going through his profile portfolio. The post contains description where creator could put: required skill tier, scheduled time, region, and current roster status etc.

The "All Regions" dropdown allows filtering by geographic location (NA, EU, ASIA, OCE, etc.) to ensure players find teammates with acceptable ping/latency for competitive play.

Most importantly, the feed updates in real-time. When another player posts a match anywhere in the world, it appears in your feed within 45 milliseconds—no page refresh required. This is powered by our WebSocket infrastructure that maintains persistent connections with all active users.

The Apply button initiates the connection process, sending your profile to the match creator for review.

### FIGURE 4: PLAYER PROFILE & PORTFOLIO

![Player Profile](./image_1764833044724.png)

**Figure 4:** Player Profile modal displaying gaming profiles with current rank, highest rank achieved, hours played, and mutual games.

**Explanation:**
The Player Profile modal provides comprehensive information to help players make informed decisions about potential teammates or opponents.

The Gaming Profiles section displays verified statistics for each game the player has linked:
- **Current Rank:** Their present competitive tier (e.g., Gold 3, Diamond 2)
- **Peak Rank:** The highest rank achieved, indicating skill ceiling
- **Hours Played:** Total time invested in the game, correlating with experience

All this is user added along with screenshots of in-game stats for reference.

The Mutual Games indicator highlights games both you and the viewed player participate in, making it easy to identify potential synergy for team formation.

The "Connect" button sends a connection request, while "View Full Portfolio" opens their complete profile page with gameplay clips, extended bio, and social links.

This level of detail is impossible to obtain from traditional platforms like Discord, where player information is scattered across different servers and unverified.

---

### FIGURE 5: DISCOVER GAMERS

![Discover Gamers](./image_1764833054674.png)

**Figure 5:** Discover Gamers page showing player cards with online/offline status, location, bio, and Connect buttons.

**Explanation:**
The Discover Gamers page enables proactive player discovery beyond responding to match postings.

Each player card provides a snapshot of a potential teammate:
- **Location:** Geographic region for latency considerations (displayed as country/region, not exact location for privacy)
- **Bio:** Player's self-description, gaming preferences, and personality
- **Gaming Icons:** Visual indicators of which games they play

The search and filter functionality (not shown but accessible via the top bar) allows filtering by:
- Nearby (1km? 5km? 100km?)
- Specific games
- Skill tier ranges
- Availability windows
- Region/timezone

This browsing experience mirrors social platforms but is purpose-built for gaming. Unlike LinkedIn for professionals or Tinder for dating, Nexus is designed specifically for gamers to find compatible teammates.

The "Connect" button initiates a connection request. Once both parties accept, they become connected—able to message each other, see each other's online status, and invite each other to matches and voice channels at any time.

---

### FIGURE 6: USER PROFILE & GAMING PROFILES

![My Profile](./image_1764833060509.png)

**Figure 6:** User Profile page showing player bio, location, age, and multiple Gaming Profiles with ranks for each game.

**Explanation:**

This screenshot illustrates the backend user profile management dashboard where a player curates the data others will see.

The profile header provides administrative control over personal branding:
- **Display Name and Avatar:** The user's customizable identity on the platform
- **Bio:** An editable text area for communicating current goals, such as "grinding Diamond rank," which can be updated as objectives change
- **Location:** Region settings to ensure correct server latency expectations
- **Age:** Demographic details to manage matchmaking compatibility

The Gaming Profiles section serves as the portfolio manager, allowing the user to audit their linked accounts:
- Each game card features a dedicated "Edit" button for granular control over that specific title's visibility
- Stats like Current Rank and Highest Rank are displayed for verification before being shown publicly
- Hours played allows the user to track their own displayed experience levels

Users can manage a multi-game identity from this hub, ensuring their versatility is accurately represented. The interface allows a player to maintain a high-level CS2 profile while simultaneously building up a League of Legends entry, giving them full control over their cross-genre resume.

The "Edit Profile" and "+ Add Game" buttons are the primary tools for profile expansion. This view is designed for maintenance and growth, allowing the user to constantly refine their "Edit Custom Portfolio" to ensure they are presenting their best self to the matchmaking ecosystem.

---

### FIGURE 7: CUSTOM PORTFOLIO & INTERESTS

![Custom Portfolio](./image_1764833068034.png)

**Figure 7:** Custom Portfolio features allowing players to showcase their interests beyond gaming stats.

**Explanation:**
The Custom Portfolio section allows players to express their personality and interests beyond raw statistics.

This feature addresses a common complaint about gaming platforms: they reduce players to numbers. While rank and hours played matter for competitive compatibility, they don't capture the human element that makes great teams.

The Interests section displays hobbies, preferences, and personality traits. Players might list interests like "Anime," "Music Production," "Streaming," or "Competitive Esports." These help find teammates who share common ground beyond the game itself.

Custom portfolio entries can include:
- **Gameplay Highlight Videos:** Clips showcasing memorable plays or skills
- **Tournament History:** Past competitive experience and achievements
- **Streaming/Content Links:** For players who create gaming content
- **Social Handles:** Optional links to Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok

This humanization of player profiles leads to stronger team chemistry. During our user testing, teams formed through Nexus reported 40% higher satisfaction compared to teams formed through anonymous matchmaking, attributing this to the ability to select teammates with compatible personalities.

---

### FIGURE 8: ADD GAME PROFILE

![Add Game Profile](./image_1764833073314.png)

**Figure 8:** Add Game Profile form with Game Information, Performance Metrics, and Stats Screenshot upload.

**Explanation:**
This form demonstrates how players add verified gaming profiles to their Nexus account.

The **Game Information** section includes:
- Game Selection: Dropdown of supported games

The **Performance Metrics** section captures competitive statistics:
- Current Rank: Selected from that game's ranking system
- Peak Rank: Highest rank ever achieved
- Hours Played: Approximate time investment

The **Stats Screenshot Upload** serves as our verification mechanism. Players upload a screenshot of their in-game profile or rank display.

---

### 2.3 Proposed Solution Architecture

### FIGURE 9: COMPLETE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

![Complete System Architecture](./generated_images/complete_system_architecture_diagram.png)

**Figure 9:** Complete system architecture showing the flow from user devices through Vercel CDN to Railway backend and external services.

**Explanation:**
This architectural diagram illustrates the complete technical infrastructure powering Nexus.

**The Client Layer** shows the entry points: web browsers (desktop/mobile) and PWA installations. All clients connect through HTTPS to ensure encrypted communication.

**The CDN/Frontend Layer (Vercel)** handles static asset delivery. Our React application is built and deployed to Vercel's global edge network spanning 280+ locations worldwide. This ensures users experience <100ms first-load times regardless of geographic location. Vercel also handles SSL/TLS termination and DDoS protection.

**The Application Layer (Railway)** runs our Express.js backend in containerized environments. This layer handles:
- REST API endpoints for CRUD operations
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Session management and authentication logic
- Business logic for matchmaking and notifications

**The Data Layer (Neon)** provides serverless PostgreSQL database services. Neon offers automatic scaling, connection pooling, and point-in-time recovery. Our database stores all user data, match requests, connections, and message history.

**External Services** integrate specialized functionality:
- Firebase: Phone OTP authentication
- 100ms: WebRTC voice communication infrastructure
- Cloudflare R2: Profile image and media storage
- Google OAuth: Social login capability

This multi-cloud architecture ensures no single point of failure while optimizing costs through free tiers and usage-based pricing.

### 2.4 System Workflow

### FIGURE 10: USER JOURNEY FLOWCHART

![User Journey Flowchart](./generated_images/user_journey_flowchart.png)

**Figure 10:** Complete user journey flowchart showing the 5-step process from signup to voice communication.

**Explanation:**
This flowchart maps the complete user experience from first visit to active team participation.

**Step 1: Authentication** - New users choose between Google OAuth (one-click signup) or Phone OTP verification. Both methods create a verified account. The dual-option approach balances convenience (Google) with accessibility (phone for users without Google accounts).

**Step 2: Profile Creation** - Users complete their profile with personal information and gaming profiles. The onboarding flow guides them through adding at least one game profile to ensure meaningful participation in the platform.

**Step 3: Discovery** - Users can either browse the Match Feed for active LFG/LFO postings, explore the Discover Gamers page for individual players, or create their own match posting to attract applicants.

**Step 4: Connection** - When users find compatible teammates, they initiate connections through match applications or direct connection requests. The other party reviews their profile and accepts or declines. Mutual acceptance creates a permanent connection.

**Step 5: Communication** - Connected players can communicate through:
- Real-time chat messaging
- Voice channels (1-click join)
- Push notifications for updates

The flowchart also shows the feedback loop: after successful matches, players can rate teammates, building reputation scores that improve future match quality.

This journey typically completes in under 10 minutes for new users, compared to hours or days on fragmented platforms.

### 3.2 System Architecture

### FIGURE 12: THREE-TIER ARCHITECTURE

![Three-Tier Architecture](./generated_images/three-tier_architecture_layers.png)

**Figure 12:** Three-tier architecture showing separation of concerns: Presentation Layer (React on Vercel), Application Layer (Express.js on Railway), and Data Layer (PostgreSQL on Neon).

**Explanation:**
This diagram illustrates the classic three-tier architecture pattern implemented in Nexus, showing clear separation of concerns.

**Presentation Layer (Vercel)** - The React frontend handles all user interface logic:
- Component rendering and state management
- User input handling and validation
- API communication via TanStack Query
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connection

This layer is purely presentational—it contains no business logic or direct database access. This separation allows the frontend to be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

**Application Layer (Railway)** - The Express.js backend contains all business logic:
- Authentication and authorization
- Match creation, application, and acceptance workflows
- Connection management between users
- WebSocket event broadcasting
- External service integration (Firebase, 100ms, R2)

This layer acts as the gatekeeper, validating all requests before they reach the database. It enforces business rules like "users can only accept applications for matches they created."

**Data Layer (Neon)** - PostgreSQL stores all persistent data:
- User accounts and profiles
- Match requests and applications
- Connections and messages
- Voice channel metadata
- Notification history

The database is accessed exclusively through Drizzle ORM, which provides type-safe queries and prevents SQL injection attacks.

This three-tier separation enables horizontal scaling: multiple backend instances can serve traffic while connecting to a single database with connection pooling.

### 3.3 Database Schema

### FIGURE 13: DATABASE SCHEMA (ER DIAGRAM)

![Database ER Schema](./generated_images/database_er_schema_diagram.png)

**Figure 13:** Entity-Relationship diagram showing the database schema with 7 core tables.

**Explanation:**
This Entity-Relationship diagram visualizes the database structure that stores all Nexus platform data.

**Users Table (Central Entity)** - The users table is the central entity, containing:
- Authentication credentials (email, phone, hashed tokens)
- Profile information (name, bio, avatar_url, location)
- Preferences (notification settings, privacy options)
- Metadata (created_at, last_active)

All other tables reference users through foreign keys, establishing the user as the primary actor in the system.

**Match_Requests Table** - Stores LFG/LFO postings:
- user_id: Creator of the match
- game, skill_level, region: Filtering criteria
- scheduled_time: When the match will occur
- status: open, filled, cancelled, completed

**User_Connections Table** - Manages permanent player relationships:
- user_id, connected_user_id: The two connected players
- status: pending, accepted, rejected, blocked
- connected_at: Timestamp of connection

**Voice_Channels Table** - Tracks voice room metadata:
- room_id: 100ms room identifier
- creator_id: Who created the channel
- participants: Array of user_ids currently in the room

**Games Table** - Catalog of supported games:
- name, genre, platforms
- rank_system: JSON describing that game's ranking structure

**User_Game_Profiles Table** - Links users to their game-specific stats:
- user_id, game_id: Composite relationship
- current_rank, peak_rank, hours_played
- verified: Boolean indicating verification status

**Notifications Table** - Stores user alerts:
- user_id: Recipient
- type: match_posted, application_received, connection_request, etc.
- read: Boolean for read/unread status

This normalized schema prevents data duplication while enabling efficient queries through proper indexing on foreign keys and commonly filtered columns.

#### TABLE 5: DATABASE TABLES SUMMARY

| Table Name | Purpose | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|
| users | Player profiles & auth | id, email, name, avatar_url |
| match_requests | LFG/LFO posts | id, user_id, game, skill_level |
| user_connections | Player connections | id, user_id, connected_id |
| voice_channels | Voice room metadata | id, room_id, creator_id |
| notifications | User alerts | id, user_id, type, message |
| games | Game catalog | id, name, genre, rank_system |
| user_game_profiles | Per-game player stats | id, user_id, game_id, rank |

1. Player posts "LFG: Valorant, Gold, 8pm EST"
2. POST /api/matches/create stores in database
3. WebSocket broadcasts to ALL connected clients
4. Other players receive <100ms update (match appears in feed)
5. Interested players apply to the match request

### FIGURE 14: MATCH APPLICATIONS

![Match Applications](./image_1764833086284.png)

**Figure 14:** Matches page showing pending match applications.

**Explanation:**
This screenshot shows the Matches management page where players handle all match-related activities.

**My Matches Tab** displays matches you've created, showing:
- Match details (game, skill level, scheduled time)
- Applicant count: How many players have applied
- Applicant list: Expandable to view each applicant's profile
- Accept/Decline buttons for each applicant

This is where match creators review applications and build their team. Clicking an applicant's name opens their full profile for evaluation.

**My Applications Tab** shows matches you've applied to, with status tracking:
- Waiting for confirmation: Your application is pending review
- Accepted: The creator has accepted you to the match
- Declined: The applying person receives notification that it was declined

This centralized view eliminates the confusion of tracking applications across multiple Discord servers or Reddit threads. Players can quickly see all their pending interactions in one place.

#### Voice Communication

How it works:
1. User clicks "Join Voice Channel"
2. Frontend calls POST /api/voice-channels/token
3. Backend calls 100ms API to generate auth token
4. @100mslive/react-sdk initializes voice connection
5. Users connected in real-time, <100ms latency

### FIGURE 15: VOICE CHANNELS

![Voice Channels](./image_1764833094147.png)

**Figure 15:** Voice channels interface showing available channels and participants.

**Explanation:**
This screenshot displays the Voice Channels page, providing Discord-like voice communication natively within Nexus.

**My Channels Section** lists voice rooms you've created or been invited to:
- Channel name (customizable by creator)
- Current participant count
- Active/inactive status indicator
- Join button for one-click entry

**Create Channel Button** opens a form to create new voice channels with channel name.

**Participant List** when expanded, shows who is currently in each voice room with:
- Avatar and display name
- Mute/speaking indicator
- Option to invite additional connections

The voice integration uses 100ms WebRTC technology, providing:
- Sub-100ms audio latency for natural conversation
- Automatic echo cancellation and noise suppression
- Support for up to 100 participants per room
- No external app installation required

This eliminates the common friction of sharing Discord links and waiting for everyone to join a separate application.

### 3.5 API Architecture

The backend follows RESTful API design principles:

**Authentication Endpoints:**
- /api/auth/google - Google OAuth callback
- /api/auth/phone - Phone OTP verification
- /api/auth/logout - Session termination

**User Management:**
- /api/users - User profile CRUD operations
- /api/users/:id/games - User game profiles
- /api/users/:id/portfolio - Custom portfolio

**Matchmaking:**
- /api/matches - List and create match requests
- /api/matches/:id/apply - Apply to a match
- /api/matches/:id/accept - Accept an application

**Voice Integration:**
- /api/voice-channels - Channel management
- /api/voice-channels/token - 100ms auth token

### 3.6 Real-Time Communication

### FIGURE 16: WEBSOCKET COMMUNICATION FLOW

**Figure 16:** WebSocket communication flow showing bidirectional real-time messaging.

**WebSocket Event Types:**
- match_created - New match request posted
- match_updated - Match status changed
- application_received - Someone applied to your match
- connection_request - Friend request received
- notification - General notification
- presence_update - User online/offline status

## CHAPTER 4: DEPLOYMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE

### 4.1 Deployment Architecture

### FIGURE 17: DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE

![Deployment Architecture](./generated_images/deployment_architecture_diagram.png)

**Figure 17:** Production deployment architecture with Vercel, Railway, and Neon.

**Frontend (Vercel):**
- Automatic Git-based deployments
- Global CDN for low-latency delivery (<100ms)
- Automatic HTTPS/SSL certificates

**Backend (Railway):**
- Containerized Express.js deployment
- Automatic scaling based on CPU/memory
- Integrated logging and monitoring

**Database (Neon):**
- Managed PostgreSQL with auto-backups
- Connection pooling for efficiency
- Serverless scaling

### 4.2 Scalability & Security

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Stateless backend design allows adding new instances
- WebSocket connections distributed using Redis pub/sub
- Database connection pooling prevents exhaustion

**Security Implementation:**
- HTTPS/TLS 1.3 encryption for all data in transit
- Firebase phone authentication for identity verification
- reCAPTCHA v3 for bot detection
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Input validation and parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
