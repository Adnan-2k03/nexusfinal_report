## ABSTRACT

### Problem Statement

Competitive and casual gamers face a significant challenge: finding suitable teammates or opponents for matches quickly and efficiently. Currently, players must rely on scattered Discord servers, social media communities, Reddit threads, and in-game chat—fragmented solutions that lack real-time updates, player verification, and dedicated communication channels. This fragmentation leads to:

- **Time Wastage:** 30-60 minutes to find a single match,months to find suitable teammate
- **searching skilled players:** No way to checkout player capabilities without personally dmming for specific
- **Communication Friction:** Switching between multiple apps (Discord, game, browser)
- **Geographic Inefficiency:** No region-based filtering
- **Low Success Rates:** 40-50% of attempted teams fail due to not being able to find suitable teammates

### Proposed Solution

**Comprehensive LinkedIn for Gamers:**

**Nexus** is a real-time player finding and team-building platform designed to solve this problem through a unified, purpose-built platform featuring:

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Objectives

**Objective:**

Build a real-time web application that enables competitive gamers to quickly find suitable teammates and opponents without wasting months, while eliminating reliance on fragmented communication channels.

### 1.2 Problem Statement & Background

#### The Problem

In competitive gaming, forming a team is challenging:

- **Time Wastage:** 30-60 minutes to find a single match, months to find suitable teammates
- **Searching Skilled Players:** No way to checkout player capabilities without personally DMing for specific gameplay clips, achievements, and rankings
- **Communication Friction:** Switching between multiple apps (Discord, game, browser) instead of one unified platform

**Example Scenario:**
A player in North America wants to find 3 teammates for a ranked tournament tomorrow. Currently, they must:
1. Post in 5+ Discord servers
2. Wait 30 minutes for responses
3. Manually ask each player for rank, achievements, and gameplay clips
4. Set up a separate Discord voice channel
5. Deal with no-shows or skill mismatches

With Nexus:
1. Post in one app: "LFG Tournament NA 8pm"
2. Match appears in the feed for other players to browse
3. Players view your portfolio and apply to join
4. Accept applicants and join in-app voice channel
5. Form a team in 5 minutes

#### Background & Competitive Gaming Industry

- **Market Size:** Competitive gaming community: ~100M+ active players globally
- **Problem Maturity:** This problem has existed for 10+ years without a unified solution
- **Current Solutions:** Fragmented, not purpose-built, requiring external tools
- **Opportunity:** Need for a dedicated, real-time platform

**Figure 11:** Three-tier architecture showing separation of concerns: Presentation Layer (React frontend on Vercel), Application Layer (Express.js backend on Railway), and Data Layer (PostgreSQL on Neon).

### 3.3 Database Schema

### FIGURE 12: DATABASE SCHEMA (ER DIAGRAM)

![Database ER Schema](./generated_images/database_er_schema_diagram.png)

**Figure 12:** Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram showing the database schema with 7 core tables: users, match_requests, user_connections, voice_channels, notifications, games, and user_game_profiles. Primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) are indicated.

#### TABLE 1: DATABASE TABLES SUMMARY

| Table Name | Purpose | Key Fields | Relationships |
|---|---|---|---|
| **users** | Player profiles & auth | id, email, name, avatar_url, region | Central entity |
| **match_requests** | LFG/LFO posts | id, user_id, game, skill_level, status | FK → users |
| **user_connections** | Player connections | id, user_id, connected_id, status | FK → users (x2) |
| **voice_channels** | Voice room metadata | id, room_id, creator_id, participants | FK → users |
| **notifications** | User alerts | id, user_id, type, message, is_read | FK → users |
| **games** | Game catalog | id, name, genre, rank_system | Referenced by profiles |
| **user_game_profiles** | Per-game player stats | id, user_id, game_id, rank, wins | FK → users, games |

### 3.4 Key Components & Features

#### Real-Time Match Finding
```
How it works:
1. Player posts "LFG: Valorant, Gold, 8pm EST"
2. POST /api/matches/create stores in database
3. WebSocket broadcasts to ALL connected clients
4. Other players' browsers receive <100ms update (match appears in feed)
5. Interested players apply to the match request

Technology:
- Frontend: React component listens to WebSocket events
- Backend: Broadcasting via ws.send() to all subscribers
- Database: PostgreSQL stores match persistence
```

**Match Applications UI:**

![Match Applications](./image_1764833086284.png)

**Figure 7:** Matches page showing pending match applications, sent applications, and match status tracking with "Waiting for confirmation" state.

#### Voice Communication
```
How it works:
1. User clicks "Join Voice Channel"
2. Frontend calls POST /api/voice-channels/token
3. Backend calls 100ms API to generate auth token
4. Frontend receives token
5. @100mslive/react-sdk initializes voice connection
6. Users connected in real-time, <100ms latency

Why 100ms over WebRTC:
- Managed infrastructure (we don't scale servers)
- Built-in recording & streaming
- Global CDN for optimal audio quality
- RTMP support for broadcasting
```

**Voice Channels UI:**

![Voice Channels](./image_1764833094147.png)

**Figure 8:** Voice Channels page showing "My Channels" with voice room management, member count, and "Join Voice Channel" button.

**In-App Messaging:**

![Chat Interface](./image_1764833100147.png)

**Figure 9:** Real-time chat interface with integrated Chat and Voice tabs, allowing players to coordinate before joining voice channels.

#### Push Notifications
```
How it works:
1. User subscribes via browser: navigator.serviceWorker.ready
2. Subscription stored in database
3. On connection accepted event, backend sends push notification
4. Service worker (sw.js) receives message
5. Desktop notification appears

Technology:
- Web Push API (W3C standard) for web browsers
- Service Workers for background handling
```

#### Authentication
```
Primary: Google OAuth
- Flow: Redirect to Google → Callback → Session created
- Endpoint: GET /auth/google/callback
- Zero SMS costs, instant signup

Secondary: Phone Verification
- Flow: Enter phone → Receive SMS OTP → Verify
- Uses Firebase Authentication
- 10 SMS/day free, then $0.01-$0.48 per SMS
```

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const { type, data } = JSON.parse(event.data);
  
  if (type === 'MATCH_POSTED') {
    // New match posted, update UI
    setMatches(prev => [...prev, data.match]);
    showNotification(`New match: ${data.match.game}`);
  }
  
  if (type === 'PLAYER_ACCEPTED') {
    // Creator accepted our match application
    playSound(); // Notification sound
  }
};

ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'SUBSCRIBE_REGION',
  region: 'NA'
}));
```

#### Backend WebSocket Handler

```javascript
// Server broadcasting to subscribers
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('subscribe_region', (region) => {
    socket.join(`region_${region}`);
  });
  
  socket.on('match_posted', (matchData) => {
    io.to(`region_${matchData.region}`).emit('match_update', matchData);
  });
});
```
