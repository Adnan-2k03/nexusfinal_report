I understand your frustration\! Seeing that same error **"Failed to resolve: com.google.firebase:firebase-auth-ktx"** even after trying to clear the cache means the old, incorrect configuration is extremely persistent.

Since the manual cache clearing and killing the Gradle Daemon didn't resolve it, the issue is likely due to the **incorrect declaration of the repositories** within your project's `settings.gradle.kts` file, which dictates where Gradle looks for dependencies.

Here is the most likely solution that specifically targets how Gradle finds its download locations, even overriding stubborn caches:

## 🛠️ Final Repository Fix

You need to ensure that the core **Google** and **Maven Central** repositories are declared globally and correctly in your **`settings.gradle.kts`** file.

### 1\. Locate the Settings File

Open your project's settings file:
$$\text{C:\Users\user\nexus\_final\android\settings.gradle.kts}$$

### 2\. Verify Repository Configuration

Check the **`dependencyResolutionManagement`** block in that file. It must explicitly list the `google()` and `mavenCentral()` repositories.

The file should look like this (pay close attention to the `repositories` block):

```kotlin
// In settings.gradle.kts (the file in your android directory)

pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.PREFER_PROJECT) // or PREFER_SETTINGS
    repositories {
        google() // <--- MAKE SURE THIS LINE IS HERE
        mavenCentral() // <--- MAKE SURE THIS LINE IS HERE
        // ... any flatDir or other repositories ...
    }
}
```

  * **Action:** If `google()` or `mavenCentral()` are missing from the **`repositories`** block under **`dependencyResolutionManagement`**, add them.

### 3\. Clean and Rerun Sync

1.  **Save** the `settings.gradle.kts` file.
2.  Go back to Android Studio.
3.  Click **File** → **Sync Project with Gradle Files**.

If this still doesn't work, try clearing the caches again after making this change, as the configuration in the settings file is the **ultimate source of truth** for where Gradle looks for the libraries it failed to resolve.

If you can confirm that your `settings.gradle.kts` file contains the lines above and the build still fails, we may need to manually add the dependency to a **non-Kotlin DSL** file if your build system is hybrid.
