Based on the context of your original guide and the screenshots you provided, you were facing or were at risk of facing two primary problems in the Ionic Appflow process:1. 🛑 Critical Build Command Failure (The Biggest Risk)This is the most likely reason your build would fail immediately if you started it.The Problem: By default, Appflow runs the standard npm run build command defined in your package.json. Your original guide specifically warns that your app's npm run build command includes a database migration step (db:push).The Error It Causes: When Appflow runs the build in a cloud environment that is not set up to handle database connections or migrations, the build will likely fail with a confusing error related to your database operations.Your Guide's Solution: Your instructions specifically required you to override this default command to only run the frontend build and Capacitor sync:$$\text{npm run build:frontend } \&\& \text{ npx cap sync}$$The Solution We Discussed: Since the Native Configs section did not show a place to put this command, the standard Appflow fix is to add a script named "appflow:build" to your package.json.2. 🔑 Missing Critical Native Configuration (The Branding Problem)You were attempting to set up a Native Config, but were uncertain what to fill in, and you saved a blank config.The Problem: If you leave the Native Config overrides blank, Appflow will use the default values in your local capacitor.config.ts. If these are set to generic IDs (like io.ionic.starter), you won't be able to submit the app to the store.The Solution We Discussed:BUNDLE_ID: You need to set a unique, professional ID (like com.nexusmatch.app).NAME: You need to set the formal app name (like Nexus Match).Summary of What You Need to Fix:ProblemRequired ActionLocationBuild Failure (DB/Migration)Add the custom build script.Your local package.json file.Missing App ID (Branding/Store)Update your Native Config Overrides.Appflow Dashboard (Native Configs).You are now aware of the correct values and the script you need to add to successfully complete the cloud build!
