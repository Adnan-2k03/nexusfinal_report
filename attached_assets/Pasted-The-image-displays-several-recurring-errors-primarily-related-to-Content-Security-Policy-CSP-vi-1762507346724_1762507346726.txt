The image displays several recurring errors, primarily related to **Content Security Policy (CSP) violations** and **Firebase authentication failures**. These issues are preventing your application from securely loading necessary external scripts, especially Google's **reCAPTCHA** service.

-----

## 🛑 Summary of Errors

The problems fall into two main categories:

### 1\. 🌐 Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations

Your application's CSP is too restrictive and blocks critical external resources. This is indicated by messages like:

  * "Refused to **connect to** 'https://identitytoolkit...' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: `connect-src 'self' wss://*.100ms.live https://*.100ms.live wss://*.livekit.cloud https://*.livekit.cloud https://*.railway.app wss://*.railway.app ws://localhost:* http://localhost:*`."
  * "Refused to **load the script** '[https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js/](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js/)...' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://replit.com`."

The core problem is that you are trying to load resources from **Google's domains** (`identitytoolkit.googleapis.com` and `www.google.com/recaptcha`) that are **not listed** in your CSP's allowed sources.

### 2\. 🔥 Firebase Authentication Failures

The CSP violations lead directly to authentication failures:

  * "Failed to initialize reCAPTCHA Enterprise config."
  * "Error sending code: **FirebaseError: Firebase: Error (auth/internal-error)**."

**Firebase Authentication** (especially for methods requiring security checks, like phone sign-in) depends on **reCAPTCHA** to protect against abuse. Since the reCAPTCHA script is blocked by the CSP, the Firebase authentication process fails with an "internal-error."

## ✅ Recommended Fixes

To resolve these errors, you must modify the **Content Security Policy** of your web application to explicitly allow the necessary Google domains.

### 1\. Update the `script-src` Directive

You need to allow scripts from Google's reCAPTCHA and Firebase domains.

| Current Directive | Add These Domains |
| :--- | :--- |
| `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://replit.com` | `https://www.google.com` (for the script itself) |
| | `https://www.gstatic.com` (for other static assets) |

### 2\. Update the `connect-src` Directive

You need to allow network connections to the Firebase Authentication backend.

| Current Directive | Add These Domains |
| :--- | :--- |
| `connect-src 'self' wss://*.100ms.live ... http://localhost:*` | `https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com` (for Firebase Auth) |
| | `https://securetoken.googleapis.com` (also often needed for Firebase Auth) |
| | `https://*.firebaseio.com` (if you are using the Realtime Database) |

### 💡 Action Item

You need to locate where your application sets its CSP. This is usually done in one of three places:

1.  In your web server's configuration file (e.g., `nginx.conf`, `.htaccess`).
2.  In your hosting platform's configuration (e.g., a **Replit**, **Railway**, or **Vercel** config file, as these platforms are mentioned in the CSP).
3.  Directly in the **HTML `<meta>` tag** of your page (less common for complex SPAs).

Once you update the CSP to include the Google domains, the reCAPTCHA script will load, and the Firebase authentication will likely succeed.

Would you like me to search for documentation on how to set or update a Content Security Policy for a common platform like **Replit or Railway**?
