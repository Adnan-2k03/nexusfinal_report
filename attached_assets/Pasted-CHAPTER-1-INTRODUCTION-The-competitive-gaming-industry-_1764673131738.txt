CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
The competitive gaming industry has experienced unprecedented growth over the past decade, with
millions of players worldwide competing in games like Valorant, Counter-Strike 2, Rocket League, Dota
2, and other esports titles. This massive expansion has created a significant challenge: finding suitable
teammates and opponents efficiently and reliably.
Currently, competitive gamers rely on fragmented and inefficient solutions to discover potential
teammates and opponents. Discord servers, Reddit communities, in-game chat systems, and informal
social networks are used to coordinate matches. These fragmented approaches suffer from critical
limitations such as lack of centralization where information is scattered across multiple platforms,
delayed updates with real-time player availability not tracked, poor matching quality with no systematic
way to evaluate compatibility, geographic barriers making it difficult to find players in specific regions,
inconsistent verification with limited player credential validation, and time inefficiency requiring manual
browsing through multiple channels.
Nexus addresses these gaps by providing a dedicated real-time platform where players can manually
browse, discover, and directly connect with compatible teammates and opponents. Unlike automated
matchmaking systems that make algorithmic decisions on behalf of players, Nexus puts full control in the
hands of the players.
1.1 Objectives
The following are the objectives of this project:
To design an efficient real-time platform that enables competitive gamers to browse and manually
discover compatible players.
To implement a player discovery system with real-time updates and advanced filtering capabilities
based on game type, skill level, and region.
To provide players with complete control over match initiation and connection decisions, ensuring
player autonomy.
To integrate real-time communication features including WebSocket notifications, instant player feeds,
and voice communication.
To create a responsive, user-friendly interface accessible across devices and operating systems.
To deploy a production-ready platform with low upfront infrastructure costs using cloud-native
technologies.
To ensure security and data privacy through robust authentication mechanisms and secure session
management.
To provide Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality enabling users to install the platform as a native
application.
