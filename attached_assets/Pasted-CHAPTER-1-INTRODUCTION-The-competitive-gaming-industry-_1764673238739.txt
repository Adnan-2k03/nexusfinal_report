CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
The competitive gaming industry has experienced unprecedented growth over the past decade, with
millions of players worldwide competing in games like Valorant, Counter-Strike 2, Rocket League, Dota
2, and other esports titles. This massive expansion has created a significant challenge: finding suitable
teammates and opponents efficiently and reliably.
Currently, competitive gamers rely on fragmented and inefficient solutions to discover potential
teammates and opponents. Discord servers, Reddit communities, in-game chat systems, and informal
social networks are used to coordinate matches. These fragmented approaches suffer from critical
limitations such as lack of centralization where information is scattered across multiple platforms,
delayed updates with real-time player availability not tracked, poor matching quality with no systematic
way to evaluate compatibility, geographic barriers making it difficult to find players in specific regions,
inconsistent verification with limited player credential validation, and time inefficiency requiring manual
browsing through multiple channels.
Nexus addresses these gaps by providing a dedicated real-time platform where players can manually
browse, discover, and directly connect with compatible teammates and opponents. Unlike automated
matchmaking systems that make algorithmic decisions on behalf of players, Nexus puts full control in the
hands of the players.
1.1 Objectives
The following are the objectives of this project:
To design an efficient real-time platform that enables competitive gamers to browse and manually
discover compatible players.
To implement a player discovery system with real-time updates and advanced filtering capabilities
based on game type, skill level, and region.
To provide players with complete control over match initiation and connection decisions, ensuring
player autonomy.
To integrate real-time communication features including WebSocket notifications, instant player feeds,
and voice communication.
To create a responsive, user-friendly interface accessible across devices and operating systems.
To deploy a production-ready platform with low upfront infrastructure costs using cloud-native
technologies.
To ensure security and data privacy through robust authentication mechanisms and secure session
management.
To provide Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality enabling users to install the platform as a native
application.
1.2 Background and Literature Survey
The competitive gaming ecosystem currently lacks a unified player discovery platform. Research into
existing solutions reveals several approaches.
Discord-based Solutions: Gaming communities primarily use Discord servers for team formation.
However, Discord lacks player-specific filtering, match history tracking, and real-time availability
indicators.
Reddit Communities: Subreddits like r/recruitplayers serve as bulletin boards but suffer from poor
organization, lack of verification, and outdated information.
In-Game Systems: Some games provide built-in matchmaking, but these are automatic and do not
provide manual control to players. Players cannot filter based on personal preferences or playstyle.
This project builds upon established research in real-time communication systems, web technologies,
and player-centric design principles to create a dedicated platform specifically designed for competitive
gaming communities.
1.3 Organization of the Report
This capstone project report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 presents the system architecture and
design, including the proposed system components and technical stack. Chapter 3 details the
implementation of core components including the player discovery system, real-time WebSocket layer,
and frontend architecture. Chapter 4 covers deployment and infrastructure, explaining how the system is
deployed on production servers with security measures. Chapter 5 presents results and discussion of
performance metrics, system reliability, and user experience testing. Chapter 6 provides cost analysis for
both MVP phase and projected scaling scenarios. Chapter 7 concludes the report with project
achievements and suggestions for future enhancements. Chapter 8 lists all references and citations used
in the project. Chapter 9 contains appendices with technical details, database schema, and API
documentation.
